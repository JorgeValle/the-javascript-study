# The JavaScript Study
An old-fashioned study room where JavaScript is thrown around, grappled with, and finally understood.

## Motivation

As the years have gone by, and I have gone deeper and deeper in my understanding of JS as a language, I've scattered what must have been thousands of files throughouts my computers, devices, hard disks and cloud locations. I feel silly that it took me this long to compile everything I'm learning into a single repository, but better late than never. Also, it might just not late at all.

My intention is to, throughout the years, once I grapple with a new concept such as:

* Functional programming
* Design patterns
* ESNext

## What this repo is not

I want to keep this repository very clean and specific to the constructs and techniques of JS as a language: no libraries or frameworks allowed. I'm currently learning TensorFlow.js - I will not put any of that code here. I'm also getting better at React - I won't put that code here either.

If a concept can be explored within the confines of vanilla JS, then it's fair game.

## Running it

To keep the emphasis on JS, I've chosen to set up this codebase to run on a Node environment - with support for ES6 through Babel. We basically load up the Babel preset on the environment, and then run specific files with the Node command.
